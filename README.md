### My dotfiles for linux

There are some dotfiles to set up a more convenient environment.
The steps are very simple.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Tsunami-S/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
sh ~/dotfiles/make_links.sh
```
#### warning   
Some of these may be something you don't need or don't want to change. if so, check what's inside and only do what you need.
