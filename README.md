### My dotfiles for linux

There are some dotfiles to set up a more convenient environment.
The steps are very simple.

### Usage
#### 1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone git@github.com:Tsunami-S/dotfiles.git
```

#### 2. Execute "make_links.sh"
Some of these may be something you don't need or don't want to change. if so, check what's inside and only do what you need.
(Please be careful. The "f" option deletes exitsting files.)

#### 3. Use "source" command or restart terminal
